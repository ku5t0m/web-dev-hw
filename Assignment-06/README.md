1.I have come across some forms as simple as these in scams and other low effort material online but have really not seen them anywhere else until this class. Usually the purpose of these are to create a simple text box to get your email and password for their benefit
2. one text box for the email with a screen shot of a well known website with the text boxes where they would normally be however you can make an error appear when they enter their email and password making the user think that it might be on their end but you have just submitted your info to the scammers every time you hit submit
3. I followed the video to the T and after that I really tried to use what you showed and to implement some of the coding that you showed as well as looked a the recommended site. It was very helpful so thank you!
