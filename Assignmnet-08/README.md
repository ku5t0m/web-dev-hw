1. I have had a great deal of learning what a headache it really can be to learn from scratch on how to do this website making stuff. It really is challenging.
2. I am really nervous that in the new section, we toss everything we just learned and start new.
3.I went through the walkthrough and tried to follow as closely as possible and then pieced with the instructions some of the previous work I had completed with current work in order to do it correctly and made minor new adjustments.
